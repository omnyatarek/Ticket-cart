## üõ†Ô∏è Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  
The page will reload when you make changes, and you may also see lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
For more information, see the [running tests section](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.  
The build is minified, and filenames include hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!  
For more information, see the [deployment section](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`
**Note: This is a one-way operation!**  
If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command removes the single build dependency from your project and copies all configuration files and dependencies (like Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project, giving you full control.  
After ejecting, all commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts, allowing you to tweak them. At this point, you‚Äôre on your own.  
You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and medium deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you‚Äôre ready.
